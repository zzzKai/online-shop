# Shopping and Ordering System
Spring and Hibernate based Shopping and Ordering System
## Introduction
You can login as two different kinds of user which are USER who are viewing or purcahsing the item and ADMIN who can add and edit items for sell. There is also a back door developer user with all authority just for testing. Because that is not stored in the database, I'm sure you can find that easily.
## Frame Works
* [Spring MVC](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html)
* [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/orm/)
